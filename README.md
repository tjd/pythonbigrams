# Simple Bigrams in Python

This code is a simple example of how to generate bigrams for a text file and
to use those to do make next-word suggestions (e.g. for auto-complete).

The code is designed to be clear and simple --- it is *not* as efficient as it
could be! Many improvements could be made.
